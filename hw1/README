There are 4 files.

PartA.html corresponds to part A of Homework 1.
I created three objects (cube, sphere, torus) with a vertex displacement shader, a phong shader, and a donut texture respectively.

PartB.html corresponds to Part B of Homework 1.
I did very simple adjustments to the Edge detection code provided in week 2 to give the image a slightly different effect that is triggered by mouse clicks.
I tried for a while to only affect a small region of the image centered around the mouse click, but it was a nightmare to line up the texture coordinates with the screen coordinates.

PartC.html corresponds to Part C of Homework 1. I applied the first effect from https://softologyblog.wordpress.com/2013/08/29/cyclic-cellular-automata/

Part4.pdf corresponds to Part 4 of Homework 1. The game that I chose was Nier: Automata, and the effect is the gravity field power.

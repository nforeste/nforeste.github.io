partB.html corresponds to part B of Homework 3.
I was heavily inspired by the code at https://www.shadertoy.com/view/lt33z7.
In fact, I used that code as a base for my fragment shader.
I added additional shapes that I found at 
http://iquilezles.org/www/articles/distfunctions/distfunctions.htm.
I also added several visual effects such as displacement and merging.
For fun I also textured a capsule to look like a hotdog and made the
background a grill. I struggled a lot getting the uv to work for the
texture, and I eventually decided to manually find the uv using the
pixel coordinates and the screen resolution.

Part C is included as a pdf document. All relavent information for that
is in the document.
